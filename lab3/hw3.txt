Homework Questions Lab 3

1. The patch removes the line that says 'case_long_iso_time_style'
because there is a goto that goes to it that is also deleted in the
patch. It was not necessary to delete it because since the goto
would never call it, it would never have been effected. It's in
a switch statement, but the switch statement would just continue
through and fall past this line. It was removed only so the code
looks cleaner.

2. Since the new patch displays dates in English and in an english
format, a company using the patch that is working with
international clients might be confused by the format and by the
language.

3. Using wget to download randline.py onto my system, I use
the command $ python randline.py /dev/null, which outputs:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    	   # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Since dev/null is empty, the randline isn't able to get a
random element, so there is an index error because the seq
is empty.

4. Running the command with python3 gives the error:
 File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Since python 3 doesn't have automatic tuple
paramater unpacking, there is an error thrown
when too many parameters are passed in.
