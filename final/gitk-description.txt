	Roles of Subwindows

The first window gives a description of what change
was made. It also shows the order of changes with
respect to the merges. 


The next box shows who made the  change with their 
name and email.

The next date shows the date and time of the change.
The dates are mostly in order, unless there are 
changes made at the same time to two different merges.

On the bottom left is we see a diff format that
shows the actual file changes so we can see 
what exactly happened during the change.

The final box on the lower right shows the names
of the files that were changed.
