        A. %rdi holds x
           %esi holds n
           %eax holds result
           %edx holds mask

        B. Result is initally set to 0
           Mask is initally set to 1

        C. testq %rdx, %rdx : If mask is not equal to 0, continue
           mask !=0;

        D. salq %cl, %rdx:  Mask gets shifted right by the bottom 8 bits of n
           mask = mask << n;

        E. andq %rdx, %r8 : First the value of x anded with mask is saved
           orq %r8 %rax: Then result Ors itself with the value saved above
           result |= (x&mask);
