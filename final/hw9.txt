	Homework 9 Log

First I want to recopy the diffutils folder:
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

I then want to checkout version 3 under a branch called 
"quote":
$ cd diffutils
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

which outputs:

Switched to a new branch 'quote'
 
Then, I want to apply the patch that I had created in the 
lab:
$ patch -p1 < ~/cs35l/lab9/gitroot/diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt

which outputs:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

I then want to see what the add-change-log-entry-other-window
command does in emacs. I see that this command adds a new entry
to the change log file for the file I am editing.
I just use emacs to add change log entrys:
$ emacs
C-x 4 a
I save the ChangeLog using C-x c, so that a copy of all the changes
I made in the directory I saved.

I then want to add and commit it using:
$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

I want to see if it works so I use 
$ git log
and see my changelog entries:

I then want to use git format-patch to create a new patch.
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I use emacs to look at the patch, and it has worked.

I then want to test that it has worked using a partner.
I scp my formatted-patch.txt out of linux and send it to
him and he does the same thing and then I scp it in.

Partner : Ryan Standt

I call his file ryan-patch.txt, and I move it to
my current directory.

I then check out v3.0 again under "partner":
$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
And then apply the patch with git am:
$ git am < ryan-patch.txt

I then build the system

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

I check that his works using
$ ./src/diff . -
and
$ ./src/diff --help

and everything is working correctly, so Ryan's patch
was succesfull.
I talked to Ryan and he said mine was also successful.

I check that my changelog works by using:
$ make distdir

This creates a new directory called diffutils-3.0.1-0e18.
So I cd into it:
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-0e18
and then I use emacs to look at the ChangeLog file.
I see that it shows:

                * src/util.c: Changed occurances of ` to ' based on a change in GNU coding standards

So it worked.

I then want to go into  ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and use
gitk.
I first use a new window to log into the linux servor:
$ ssh -X jeanne@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

I then switch directories:
$ cd  ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

And I make sure my path is correct:
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

Finally, I use gitk
$ gitk
which opens up a new window in XQuartz, which is shown in
my screenshot.

The newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25 occurs
on 2015-01-15 where the description reads "Merge branch
'master' into xwidget". There is also a merge on 2015-01-24
that is "merge master".
