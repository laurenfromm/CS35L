First, I want to install Coreutils 7.6.
I use wget and the link:
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
This downloads the tarbel into my directory.

Next I want to untar and unzip:
$ tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
Which outputs all the files that are unzipped.

Next, I make a directory for coreutils:
$ mkdir coreutilsInstall

Next, I go into the coreutils-7.6 directory:
$ cd coreutils-7.6
I use ls to see all the contents.
To look at the INSTALL file, I use:
$ emacs INSTALL
Here, I read about configure, make and make install.
So coreutils is installed in the directory I made, I use the --prefix flag.
$ ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/jeanne/coreutilsInstall

I then use make and make install to put the contents in my new directory:
$ make
$ make install
All 3 of these commands give long outputs, which are updates on the process.

I then enter the directory to make sure things have installed:
$ cd ~/coreutilsInstall
$ ls
I see that bin, lib, and share are in the directory
The install was successful.

I then want to reproduce the bug by using ls. 
I need to call the version of ls in bin for it to work correctly:
$ ./bin/ls -l
This outputs alot of files, for example:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jeanne csugrad 127248 2017-10-20 11:04 [
Which is the incorrect version because it uses:
yyyy-mm-dd tt:tt
We want:
Month day year

I then go back to the original folder:
$ cd ~/cs35l/lab3/coreutiles-7.6
I want to create a patch file with vim:
$ vim patch_file
I copy and paste Brady's patch into this file.

To run the patch, I use:
$ patch -p1 < patch_file

After the patch was successfuly added, I run make again:
$ make
To test, I run the ls command in src:
$ ./src/ls -l
And I see that all the files are displaying the correct format.
For example:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jeanne csugrad 127248 Oct 20 11:03 [
So the patch worked.

To test, I create a new file:
$ touch new_file
I also create a file that is a year old:
$ touch -t 201401210959.30 test_file

I then test ls in both folders:
In our old, unmoddified coreutilsInstall:
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeanne csugrad      0 2017-10-20 12:34 new_file
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeanne csugrad      0 2014-01-21 09:59 test_file

In the new, modified coreutils-7.6
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeanne csugrad      0 Oct 20 12:40 new_file
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeanne csugrad      0 Jan 21  2014 test_file

So the patch was successful!
