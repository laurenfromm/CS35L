1.To print commands that have a word in their manuel page, I use 'man -k word'.
 'word' can be replaced  with the word you want to search for.

2. I use "which cp" to find that the cp program is located in /usr/bin/cp.
I reuse "which wc" to find that the wc program is located in /usr/bin/wc.

3. The programs are all in /usr/bin, I search there for 1 char commands. 
I use '?' to match any single character.
The final command is 'find /usr/bin -name "?"'. This gives me:
/usr/bin/[
/usr/bin/w
/usr/bin/X
Using the man command, I can find the uses of all these commands. 
'man [' :'[' is a test command and checks file types and compares values. 
'man w' :'w' shows who is logged in and what they are doing. 
'man X' :'X' is the original X server executable on the windows system. 

4. I use the command "readlink /usr/bin/emacs".
The file actually being executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5. Using "man chmod" I know 'g' means other users in the file's group.
'o' means other users not in the file's group. 
So, 'g+s' sets a group id on execution for the users in the file's group.
'o-x' removes permission to execute from users not in the file's group.

6.I used the command 'man find' to find how to use -mtime.  
I use "find -mtime -21".
This finds all files that have been modified in the past 3 weeks.

7. I need to specify the type by using "find / -type d -mtime -21".
I am using my own machine on lnxsrv07 network.
So I instead  use 'find . -type d -mtime -21'.
This finds the directories modified on my machine in the past 3 weeks:
.
./cs35l
./cs35l/assignment1
./.cache/abrt
./perl5
./.emacs.d/auto-save-list

8. Using "man find" I know to look for symbolic link, I need to use '-type l'. 
I use 'whereis find' to find where the command is located, which is /usr/bin.
The command is "find /usr/bin -type l", which gives a long list of the links. 
I use the pipe '|' with 'wc', a function that will count all the lines. 
So my final command is 'find /usr/bin -type l|wc' which gives me:
246     246    4206
So there are 246 symbolic links on lnxsrv07.

9. First, I switch to /usr/bin by using 'cd /usr/bin'.
I use 'man ls' to learn how to list files in order. 
I then can use 'ls -lt, to list the files with their dates. 
If I only want to see one file, I use "ls -lt -1". 
To get the very last line, I want to use the 'tail' command.
The final command to see the oldest file is 'ls -lt|tail -1', which gives me:
-rwxr-xr-x.   1 root root        3584 Sep  8  2000 detect_ppa
so detect_ppa is the oldest on lnxsrv07.

10. By using 'man locale', locale gets locale-specific data from 'localedef'.
Localdef compiles locale definition files by reading charmap and input files.
If no charmap files are given, the value ANSI_X3.4-1968 is used by default. 
If no input file is given, localedef reads from standard input.

11. In emacs, by using 'C-h a', you can search through all the commands. 
By typing in sort, I see that emacs has the following commands:

Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
 Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
 Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
 Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
 line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
 Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
 order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
 Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
 Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
 order.
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
 Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
 order.
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
 Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
 Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET
 Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

12. "C-h k" allows me to enter the keys to see a description of the command.
I did that for each of the following:
    C-M-a : Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
    C-M-b : Move backward across one balanced expression
    C-M-c : Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
    C-M-d : Move forward down one level of parentheses.
    C-M-e : Move forward to next end of defun.
    C-M-f : Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
    C-M-g : none
    C-M-h : Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13. I used "C-h k" again in order to find the function of C-g. 
C-g: Runs the command keyboard-quit.
This is an interactive compiled Lisp function, signals a 'quit' condition. 
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
As an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. I use "C-h w" and search 'yank' to find which keys activate yank. 
I see C-y activates yank, I use "C-h k" and enter C-y to see yank's use. 
Yank reinserts ("pastes" the last stretch of killed text. 
More precisely, it reinserts the most recent kill.

15. The first thing I do is use "C-h w" and search "dired".
I find the keys to use to access it, which is 'C-x d'.
Then I use the dired and seach '/usr/bin'.
In another linux window I enter the directory.
I use 'cd /usr/bin' and then the command 'ls -l'. 
The only differences I notice is at the beginning of dired, it states 
"total used in directory 301724 available 13313004"
but when I use the 'ls -l' command, it states 
"total 301648".
Also, when using dired, the two following files appear:
 dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Sep 16 13:15 .
 drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Nov 18  2016 .. 
These two files don't appear when using 'ls -l'.
